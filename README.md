# Project Title: Life Expectancy Data Analysis

## Author: Elisa Tladi

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing the Life Expectancy dataset provided by Kumraa Jarshi. The dataset includes various factors affecting life expectancy, such as immunization rates, GDP, and other health-related factors, from 193 countries between 2000-2015. For this project, the focus is narrowed to 47 African countries to explore the importance of various components beyond immunization and GDP on life expectancy.

## Files in Repository
1. **Life_expectancy_queries.sql**: Contains all SQL queries used in the analysis.
2. **Project_Presentation.pdf**: Contains the project presentation detailing the findings and visualizations.
3. **Life_Expectancy_Analysis.xlsx**: Excel file used for initial data manipulation and analysis.
4. **Life_Expectancy_Data.pdf**: PDF file used for initial data manipulation and analysis.
5. **README.md**: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the "Life Expectancy WHO" dataset available on Kaggle. It includes various health, economic, and social indicators that potentially affect life expectancy. More information about the dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who).
